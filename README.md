# phn-repo

just a repo autobuilding packages in the AUR that I use regularly

add this to the end of your ```pacman.conf```

SigLevel = TrustAll
Server = http://downloads.sourceforge.net/phn-repo/repo
````

this wont be maintained anymore, complete redesign happening on the phantomsarch repo, this will be dead either when this stuff gets deleted or whenever github actions decides to stop working
